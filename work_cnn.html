            <ol class="change-list">
                <li>
                    <span>Model performance:</span>
                    <p>The VGG16 pre-trained model performs better in terms of accuracy compared to the self-trained CNN model. This is likely due to the extensive feature extraction capabilities of VGG16, which has been trained on a much larger dataset, enabling it to recognize more complex patterns.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Training Efficiency:</span>
                    <p>Despite the smaller batch size and increased evaluation steps, the pre-trained model utilizing VGG16 still achieved better accuracy, suggesting that it handles smaller, more frequent updates effectively, which might have contributed to its superior performance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Model Architecture:</span>
                    <p>The pre-trained VGG16 model has a much larger parameter count and leverages pre-trained weights. This makes it more powerful in recognizing complex features, whereas the self-trained CNN model, with fewer parameters and no pre-trained knowledge, performs less effectively in comparison.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Inference Time:</span>
                    <p>The inference time per step for the VGG16 model is slightly shorter (74ms/step) than the self-trained model (106ms/step), despite the higher parameter count. This might be due to VGG16's optimized architecture for image recognition tasks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Dense layer design impact:</span>
                    <p>The additional dense layer in VGG16 allows for more abstracted feature transformation before the final classification, which could contribute to its better accuracy, as it enables a more refined mapping between extracted features and classes.</p>
